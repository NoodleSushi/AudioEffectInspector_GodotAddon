Audio Effects could be confusing to users who may be unfamiliar with the Audio Engineering environment and its tools. Looking at sliders with no visual feedback may seem a little daunting. This is where the Audio Effect Inspector comes in handy! It enables you to control your tools much easier with a graphical interface; like any VST plugin used in DAWs.
